## Run c++ algorithm

Assuming you have installed cmake on your computer :

* Open a terminal in the /build and run "cmake .." . This command will generate a Makefile.
* Then run "make" to generate your exec.
* You can now run your exec named main with "./main".

To clear all the generated files by cmake :

* delete all the files in the build folder
